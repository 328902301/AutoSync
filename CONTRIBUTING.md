## Submitting an issue

You can submit an issue on https://github.com/abp-filters/abp-filters-anti-cv/issues. We recommend using our issue template so that we can reproduce the issue and tackle it ASAP.
 
## Creating a pull request

We prefer you to file a detailed [issue report](https://github.com/abp-filters/abp-filters-anti-cv/issues) instead of creating a pull request. We kindly ask that you only [create a pull request](https://github.com/abp-filters/abp-filters-anti-cv/pulls) if you consider yourself experienced in writing filters and your request solely covers the issue that you want to report.
