## Adding or Updating Lists

To submit a new list or update data about an existing list, please submit a pull request to this directory in conjunction with the data model described [here](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/wiki/Data-Model_sidebar). Alternatively, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues/new) providing information for all of the fields described in the [data model](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/wiki/Data-Model_sidebar).

*Note: We prefer not to re-use `Id`s. So, when submitting a PR, add any new lists, maintainers, etc. with the next incremental Id at the end of the list (rather than filling in a hole in the sequence that may have been left by a previously removed entity).
