* [Search Blocklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-blocklist/lmmlebipfkjpbddppdkobgfonflpifkk)
* [Google Personal Blocklist](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef) (Discontinued)
* [Google Hit Hider by Domain](https://www.jeffersonscher.com/gm/google-hit-hider/)

Note that Blocklist is a long list and could be too big for some extensions/scripts, depends on its blocking logic and performance.
