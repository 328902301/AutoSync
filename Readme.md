# Host-List for iOS ad blockers
Huge update as of 28th February, 2020: A recently abandoned mobile blocklist has been merged with iOSAdblockList.
This list is focused on iOS and can be used on Android devices.

In order to get notified from an update, mark my repository as "watched".

If you notice ads, please create an issue or contact me via reddit u/neidhardterik . (Note that ads on Youtube, Messenger, Instagram and some other social media platforms can't be blocked due to the host format.)
For new users i recommend Adguard Pro, as it allows you to subscribe to a list without the need of manually updating the list.
